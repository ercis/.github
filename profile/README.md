Dear visitors,

Welcome to the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS). We are a lively international network of research institutions and companies, working together in the field of Information Systems.

We would like to encourage you to have a look at our website to find out more about us, our current research projects, publications, joint teaching activities or events, where we regularly meet and exchange ideas. We all enjoy the ERCIS spirit and it is always great to have so many motivated and inspiring colleagues around.
